# How to delete my account

Open the application and navigate to the account tab. In this page, there is a red button to delete your account and ALL your data from our storage. We do not store anymore anything related to you after this step, we don't need it. This include the small set of personal data we store (email, display name, and your generated user id), all your counters and all the counter subscriptions you had.
